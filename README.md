# Template for Using Miniconda on AppVeyor for Continuous Integration Testing

Testing tricky Python extensions on AppVeyor using miniconda to speed up the environment setup and simplifying builds that include `C` code from projects like `numpy`.

Inspired by [python-appveyor-demo](https://github.com/ogrisel/python-appveyor-demo) and [cookiecutter-pylibrary](https://github.com/ionelmc/cookiecutter-pylibrary).

## Note

This can be used together with its twin [python-conda-travis](https://github.com/Midnighter/python-conda-travis) to have complete testing on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows using miniconda.
